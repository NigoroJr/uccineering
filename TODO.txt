METHODS
=======
Some potential methods to add to the Moderator class.

* dump time durations
    We can use this to monitor how much time it takes to go down N ply.
* order moves
    Sort moves so that we can maximize pruning. Use priority queue?

    for t in threads
        t.assign_search(p_queue.top())
        p_queue.pop()
    endfor

* get depth limit
    Method that determines the depth limit for the current search. This will be
    useful when having variable depth limits.


OTHERS
======

* Eval function
    take away from opponent + reserve for own?
    Probot - reserve -> 4th -> take away

* transposition table?

* how to keep track of time?
    event-driven (t.stop_processing if time.now > time_limit)
    interrupt (using thread::sleep)

* switching between think-while-wait and own turn

* how to organize opening init file

* tapping in moves (tell program to place tile at certain location on move X)
  for debugging purposes
